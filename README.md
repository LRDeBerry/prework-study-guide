# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This project was created for students going through boot camp. My motivation for completing this project is wanting to solve problems and to be creative with building various projects. I built this project because I wanted to learn a new skill and to push myself. Even with my limited knowledge in the field, this is a great starting point to build for the future. This project has given me the chance to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and what it takes to be a full stack developer.
