# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This project was created for students going through boot camp. My motivation for completing this project is wanting to problem solve and create at the same time. I built this project because I want to learn a new skill for my love of developing and a career change. This solves my limited knowledge in the field and a great starting point to build for my future. This project has given me the chance to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and basic principles of Web Development.
